What is a Server?
A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.

There are both similarities and differences between desktop computers and servers. Most servers are based on X86/X64 CPUs and can run the same code as an X86/X64 desktop computer. Unlike most desktop computers, however, physical servers often include multiple CPU sockets and error correcting memory. Servers also generally support a far greater quantity of memory than most desktop computers.
