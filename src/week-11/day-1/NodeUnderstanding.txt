1-What is Node.JS?
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient and also achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node.js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

2-What problem does Node.JS solve?
Node.js has a unique advantage because developers now can write the server side code and the client side with the same JS not as before that needed to do it with a different language.

3-What is the V8 Javascript Engine?
Chrome V8 is a JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. Chrome V8, or just V8, can execute JavaScript code either within or outside of a browser, which makes server-side scripting possible.

4-Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?
It is, since let the developers to run js in Node instead of a browser and also lets control the version we would like to use.

5-What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?
The main difference is that we can control the version where to run the app on.

6-What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?
NVM allows you to easily install and manage different versions of Node and switch between them.
